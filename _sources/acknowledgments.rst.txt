Support
-------
The development of BLDFM was supported by the following organizations and funding sources:

- **European Research Council (ERC)** under the European Unionâ€™s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme (Grant agreement No 951288, Q-Arctic).
- **Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)** through the Collaborative Research Center (CRC) 1114 "Scaling Cascades in Complex Systems", project number 235221301, project A02: "Multiscale data and asymptotic model assimilation for atmospheric flows."
- **Schmidt Sciences, LLC** as part of the Climate Modeling Alliance and the Virtual Earth System Research Institute's DataWave project.

We also acknowledge the use of open-source libraries and tools, including `NumPy`, `SciPy`, and `Matplotlib`, which were instrumental in the development of BLDFM.

If you use BLDFM in your research, please consider citing the associated publication or acknowledging the project in your work.

Comparison model
----------------
The Kormann-Meixner footprint model was used as a comparison to BLDFM. The implementation utilized is based on the work of Zhan Li, originally available at:

`<https://github.com/zhanlilz/fluxfm/blob/master/fluxfm/ffm_kormann_meixner.py>`_

The implementation is itself based on a MATLAB script by Jakob Sievers (05/2013) and was revised and annotated by Christian Wille. All rights to the original work remain with the respective authors.
