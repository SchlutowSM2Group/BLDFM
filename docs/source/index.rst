Welcome to BLDFM's Documentation!
==================================

The **Boundary Layer Dispersion and Footprint Model (BLDFM)** is a atmospheric dispersion and footprint model designed for microscale applications in the planetary boundary layer (PBL). It numerically solves the three-dimensional steady-state advection-diffusion equation in Eulerian form, providing robust tools for modeling scalar transport under various turbulent regimes.

This documentation serves as a guide to understanding, configuring, and extending BLDFM for your specific use cases. This documentation aims to be accessible to researchers, developers, or practitioners. If you spot a feature gap in BLDFM or space for improvement in the documentation, feel free to reach out with a contribution or an issue!


Key Features
------------

- **Numerical Solver**: Efficiently solves the steady-state advection-diffusion equation using Fourier transforms and numerical methods like the Semi-Implicit Euler (SIE) and Exponential Integrator (EI).
- **Atmospheric Stability**: Computes vertical profiles of mean wind and eddy diffusivity using Monin-Obukhov Similarity Theory (MOST).
- **Customizability**: Easily extendable with additional turbulence closures and parameterizations.
- **Validation**: Tested against analytical solutions and benchmark models, ensuring accuracy and reliability.
- **Example Workflows**: Includes pre-configured scripts for footprint modeling and dispersion analysis.
