# BLDFM Parallel Example Configuration
# =====================================
# High-resolution dispersion run using multiple threads.
# Equivalent to: examples/low_level/parallel_example.py
# Run with: bldfm run examples/configs/parallel.yaml

  nz: 512                # vertical levels
  xmax: 2000.0           # domain extent in x [m]
