The Boundary Layer Dispersion and Footprint Model (BLDFM) is a novel atmospheric dispersion and footprint model designed for microscale applications in the atmospheric boundary layer under various turbulent regimes. It numerically solves the three-dimensional steady-state advection-diffusion equation in Eulerian form with flux boundary conditions.

## Features

- **Numerical Solver**: Solves the steady-state advection-diffusion equation using Fourier transforms and the linear shooting method.
- **Fast and Robust**: Utilizes the Fast Fourier Transform and Exponential Integrator Method for computational efficiency.
- **Atmospheric Stability**: Computes vertical profiles of mean wind and eddy diffusivity using Monin-Obukhov Similarity Theory.
- **Validation**: Tested against analytical solutions with relative differences of less than 0.1â€° under typical conditions.
- **Comparison**: Demonstrates general agreement with the Kormann and Meixner footprint model, highlighting differences in turbulent mixing.

## Requirements

See [`pyproject.toml`](https://github.com/SchlutowSM2Group/BLFDM/blob/main/pyproject.toml).

<!-- --- -->

## Usage

### Installation

Install the package using pip:

```bash
# BLDFM root directory
$ pip install -e .
```

### Running Example Scripts
The example scripts are located in the `runs` subdirectory. After installation, you can run them as follows:
```bash
# BLDFM root directory
$ python -m runs.example_script_name
```
Replace `example_script_name` with the desired script, such as `comparison_footprint`.

### Execution without installation
To execute a specific example without first installing BLDFM, clone the repository and run the script. For example:
```bash
# BLDFM root directory
$ python -m runs.comparison_footprint
```

Refer to the documentation for details on available APIs and how to create custom experiments.

### Optional dependencies
Additional dependencies for documentation or testing can be found under `optional-dependencies` in `pyproject.toml`. These dependencies can be installed via
```bash
# BLDFM root directory
$ pip install '.[dev]'
```
